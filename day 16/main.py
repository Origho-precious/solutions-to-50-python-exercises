# Question 60:
# Write a program to compute:

# f(n)=f(n-1)+100 when n>0
# and f(0)=0
# with a given n input by console (n>0).

# Example: If the following n is given as input to the program:

# 5
# Then, the output of the program should be:

# 500
# In case of input data being supplied to the question, it should be assumed to be a console input.

# Hints:
# We can define recursive function in Python.


# Question 61:
# The Fibonacci Sequence is computed based on the following formula:

# f(n) = 0 if n = 0
# f(n) = 1 if n = 1
# f(n) = f(n-1)+f(n-2) if n > 1
# Please write a program to compute the value of f(n) with a given n input by console.

# Example: If the following n is given as input to the program:
# 7

# Then, the output of the program should be:
# 13

# In case of input data being supplied to the question, it should be assumed to be a console input.

# Hints:
# We can define recursive function in Python.

# Question 62:
# The Fibonacci Sequence is computed based on the following formula:

# f(n) = 0 if n = 0
# f(n) = 1 if n = 1
# f(n) = f(n-1)+f(n-2) if n > 1
# Please write a program to compute the value of f(n) with a given n input by console.

# Example: If the following n is given as input to the program:

# 7
# Then, the output of the program should be:

# 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13
# In case of input data being supplied to the question, it should be assumed to be a console input.

# Hints;
# We can define recursive function in Python. Use list comprehension to generate a list from an existing list. Use string.join() to join a list of strings.


# Question 63:
# Please write a program using generator to print the even numbers between 0 and n in comma separated form while n is input by console.

# Example: If the following n is given as input to the program:

# 10
# Then, the output of the program should be:

# 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10
# In case of input data being supplied to the question, it should be assumed to be a console input.

# Hints:
# Use yield to produce the next value in generator.


# Question 64:
# Please write a program using generator to print the numbers which can be divisible by 5 and 7 between 0 and n in comma separated form while n is input by console.

# Example: If the following n is given as input to the program:

# 100
# Then, the output of the program should be:

# 0, 35, 70
# In case of input data being supplied to the question, it should be assumed to be a console input.

# Hints:
# Use yield to produce the next value in generator.
