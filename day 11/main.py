# Question 38:
# With a given tuple(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10), write a program to print the first half values in one line and the last half values in one line.

# Hints:
# Use[n1:n2] notation to get a slice from a tuple.


# Question 39:
# Write a program to generate and print another tuple whose values are even numbers in the given tuple(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10).

# Hints:
# Use "for" to iterate the tuple. Use tuple() to generate a tuple from a list.


# Question 40:
# Write a program which accepts a string as input to print "Yes" if the string is "yes" or "YES" or "Yes", otherwise print "No".

# Hints:
# Use if statement to judge condition.


# Question 41:
# Write a program which can map() to make a list whose elements are square of elements in [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10].

# Hints:
# Use map() to generate a list.Use lambda to define anonymous functions.


# Question 42:
# Write a program which can map() and filter() to make a list whose elements are square of even number in [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10].

# Hints:
# Use map() to generate a list.Use filter() to filter elements of a list.Use lambda to define anonymous functions.


# Question 43:
# Write a program which can filter() to make a list whose elements are even number between 1 and 20 (both included).

# Hints:
# Use filter() to filter elements of a list.Use lambda to define anonymous functions.
