# Question 20:
# Define a class with a generator which can iterate the numbers, which are divisible by 7, between a given range 0 and n.

# Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:

# 7
# Then, the output should be:

# 0
# 7
# 14
# Hints:
# Consider use class , function and comprehension.

# Main author's Solution: Python 2

# The solution code for this problem was not as reltive to as the problem mentioned and there was a typing mistake while calling the function.


# Question 21:
# A robot moves in a plane starting from the original point(0, 0). The robot can move toward UP, DOWN, LEFT and RIGHT with a given steps. The trace of robot movement is shown as the following:

# UP 5
# DOWN 3
# LEFT 3
# RIGHT 2
# The numbers after the direction are steps. Please write a program to compute the distance from current position after a sequence of movement and original point. If the distance is a float, then just print the nearest integer. Example: If the following tuples are given as input to the program:

# UP 5
# DOWN 3
# LEFT 3
# RIGHT 2
# Then, the output of the program should be:

# 2
# Hints:
# In case of input data being supplied to the question, it should be assumed to be a console input.Here distance indicates to euclidean distance.Import math module to use sqrt function.
