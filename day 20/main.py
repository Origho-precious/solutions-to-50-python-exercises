# Question 80:
# Please write a program to print the list after removing even numbers in [5, 6, 77, 45, 22, 12, 24].

# Hints:
# Use list comprehension to delete a bunch of element from a list.


# Question 81:
# By using list comprehension, please write a program to print the list after removing numbers which are divisible by 5 and 7 in [12, 24, 35, 70, 88, 120, 155].

# Hints:
# Use list comprehension to delete a bunch of element from a list.


# Question 82:
# By using list comprehension, please write a program to print the list after removing the 0th, 2nd, 4th, 6th numbers in [12, 24, 35, 70, 88, 120, 155].

# Hints:
# Use list comprehension to delete a bunch of element from a list. Use enumerate() to get(index, value) tuple.


# Question 83:
