# Question 85:
# By using list comprehension, please write a program to print the list after removing the 0th, 4th, 5th numbers in [12, 24, 35, 70, 88, 120, 155].

# Hints:
# Use list comprehension to delete a bunch of element from a list.Use enumerate() to get(index, value) tuple.


# Question 86:
# By using list comprehension, please write a program to print the list after removing the value 24 in [12, 24, 35, 24, 88, 120, 155].

# Hints:
# Use list's remove method to delete a value.


# Question 87:
# With two given lists[1, 3, 6, 78, 35, 55] and [12, 24, 35, 24, 88, 120, 155], write a program to make a list whose elements are intersection of the above given lists.

# Hints:
# Use set() and "&=" to do set intersection operation.


# Question 88:
# With a given list[12, 24, 35, 24, 88, 120, 155, 88, 120, 155], write a program to print this list after removing all duplicate values with original order reserved.

# Hints:
# Use set() to store a number of values without duplicate.


# Question 89:
# Define a class Person and its two child classes: Male and Female. All classes have a method "getGender" which can print "Male" for Male class and "Female" for Female class .

# Hints:
# Use Subclass(Parentclass) to define a child class .
