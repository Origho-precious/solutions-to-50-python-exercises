# Question 22:
# Write a program to compute the frequency of the words from the input. The output should output after sorting the key alphanumerically.

# Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:

# New to Python or choosing between Python 2 and Python 3? Read Python 2 or Python 3.
# Then, the output should be:

# 2: 2
# 3.: 1
# 3?: 1
# New: 1
# Python: 5
# Read: 1
# and: 1
# between: 1
# choosing: 1
# or: 2
# to: 1
# Hints
# In case of input data being supplied to the question, it should be assumed to be a console input.


# Question:
# Write a method which can calculate square value of number

# Hints:
# Using the ** operator which can be written as n**p where means n ^ p


# Question 24:
# Python has many built-in functions, and if you do not know how to use it, you can read document online or find some books. But Python has a built-in document function for every built-in functions.

# Please write a program to print some Python built-in functions documents, such as abs(), int(), raw_input()

# And add document for your own function

# Hints:
# The built-in document method is __doc__


# Question25:
# Define a class , which have a class parameter and have a same instance parameter.

# Hints:
