# Question 18:
# A website requires the users to input username and password to register. Write a program to check the validity of password input by users.

# Following are the criteria for checking the password:
# At least 1 letter between [a-z]
# At least 1 number between [0-9]
# At least 1 letter between [A-Z]
# At least 1 character from [$#@]
# Minimum length of transaction password: 6
# Maximum length of transaction password: 12

# Your program should accept a sequence of comma separated passwords and will check them according to the above criteria. Passwords that match the criteria are to be printed, each separated by a comma.

# Example

# If the following passwords are given as input to the program:

# ABd1234@1,a F1#,2w3E*,2We3345
# Then, the output of the program should be:

# ABd1234@1
# Hints:
# In case of input data being supplied to the question, it should be assumed to be a console input.

import re

passwords = input('Enter comma seperated passwords: ').split(',')


def validate_password(password):
    if (len(password) < 6 or len(password) > 12):
        return ''
    if re.search(r'[0-9]+', password) is None:
        return ''
    if re.search(r'[a-z]+', password) is None:
        return ''
    if re.search(r'[A-Z]+', password) is None:
        return
    if re.search(r'[$#@]+', password) is None:
        return ''

    return password


print(','.join([item for item in passwords if validate_password(item)]))

# Question 19:
# You are required to write a program to sort the (name, age, score) tuples by ascending order where name is string, age and score are numbers. The tuples are input by console. The sort criteria is:

# 1: Sort based on name
# 2: Then sort based on age
# 3: Then sort by score
# The priority is that name > age > score.

# If the following tuples are given as input to the program:

# Tom, 19, 80
# John, 20, 90
# Jony, 17, 91
# Jony, 17, 93
# Json, 21, 85
# Then, the output of the program should be:

# [('John', '20', '90'), ('Jony', '17', '91'),
#  ('Jony', '17', '93'), ('Json', '21', '85'), ('Tom', '19', '80')]
# Hints:
# In case of input data being supplied to the question, it should be assumed to be a console input.We use itemgetter to enable multiple sort keys.
