# Question 31:
# Define a function which can print a dictionary where the keys are numbers between 1 and 20 (both included) and the values are square of keys.

# Hints:
# Use dict[key]=value pattern to put entry into a dictionary.Use ** operator to get power of a number.Use range() for loops.



# Question 32:
# Define a function which can generate a dictionary where the keys are numbers between 1 and 20 (both included) and the values are square of keys. The function should just print the keys only.

# Hints:
# Use dict[key]=value pattern to put entry into a dictionary.Use ** operator to get power of a number.Use range() for loops.Use keys() to iterate keys in the dictionary. Also we can use item() to get key/value pairs.


# Question 33:
# Define a function which can generate and print a list where the values are square of numbers between 1 and 20 (both included).

# Hints:
# Use ** operator to get power of a number.Use range() for loops.Use list.append() to add values into a list.


# Question 34:
# Define a function which can generate a list where the values are square of numbers between 1 and 20 (both included). Then the function needs to print the first 5 elements in the list.

# Hints:
# Use ** operator to get power of a number.Use range() for loops.Use list.append() to add values into a list.Use[n1:n2] to slice a list


# Question 35:
# Define a function which can generate a list where the values are square of numbers between 1 and 20 (both included). Then the function needs to print the last 5 elements in the list.

# Hints:
# Use ** operator to get power of a number.Use range() for loops.Use list.append() to add values into a list.Use[n1:n2] to slice a list

# Question 36:
# Define a function which can generate a list where the values are square of numbers between 1 and 20 (both included). Then the function needs to print all values except the first 5 elements in the list.

# Hints: Use ** operator to get power of a number.Use range() for loops.Use list.append() to add values into a list.Use[n1:n2] to slice a list


# Question 37:
# Define a function which can generate and print a tuple where the value are square of numbers between 1 and 20 (both included).

# Hints:
# Use ** operator to get power of a number.Use range() for loops.Use list.append() to add values into a list.Use tuple() to get a tuple from a list.
