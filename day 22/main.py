# Question 90:
# Please write a program which count and print the numbers of each character in a string input by console.

# Example: If the following string is given as input to the program:
# abcdefgabc

# Then, the output of the program should be:
# a,2
# c,2
# b,2
# e,1
# d,1
# g,1
# f,1

# Hints:
# Use dict to store key/value pairs. Use dict.get() method to lookup a key with default value.


# Question 91:
# Please write a program which accepts a string from console and print it in reverse order.

# Example: If the following string is given as input to the program: *
# rise to vote sir

# Then, the output of the program should be:
# ris etov ot esir

# Hints:
# Use list[::-1] to iterate a list in a reverse order.


# Question 92:
# Please write a program which accepts a string from console and print the characters that have even indexes.

# Example: If the following string is given as input to the program:
# H1e2l3l4o5w6o7r8l9d

# Then, the output of the program should be:
# Helloworld

# Hints:
# Use list[::2] to iterate a list by step 2.


# Question 93:
# Please write a program which prints all permutations of[1, 2, 3]

# Hints:
# Use itertools.permutations() to get permutations of list.


# Question 94:
# Write a program to solve a classic ancient Chinese puzzle: We count 35 heads and 94 legs among the chickens and rabbits in a farm. How many rabbits and how many chickens do we have?

# Hints:
# Use for loop to iterate all possible solutions.
